Portfolio optimization is a fundamental tool in financial decision-making, aiming to establish an optimal asset allocation strategy. This report aimed to replicate the process of making a Monte-Carlo simulation of possible portfolio behavior and constructing an Efficient Frontier, by following the guidance from the QuantPy youtube channel. The goal of this paper is to provide investors with detailed information on the inherent risks and returns associated with diverse asset allocations.

Various mathematical methods were used for calculating the asset distribution. It involved calculating mean returns and covariance matrix of stocks based on historical data, optimizing the variance and Sharpe ratio, which compares the return on investment with its risk, and creating the heat map to visualize the efficient frontier to choose the optimal allocation of assets in a portfolio.

The main goal is to show how the integration of Monte Carlo methods, standard distribution analysis, minimization techniques, and heat maps can be strategically employed to optimize asset allocation within a portfolio. This report outlines the methodologies used to address this question and presents key findings derived from the simulations, giving specific information on portfolio returns with the a combination of highest returns and minimum risks.
